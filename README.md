Hey all,here I used html,CSS media queries to style and make it responsive,and at last our favourite javascript to manage the cart.I used Firebase to store the data and Netlify to deploy it.
I got the gif for my site directly from GIFER.
To visit my deployed site,go https://cartcompanion.netlify.app/
